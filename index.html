<p class="maintext"> Black and Hispanic New Yorkers comprise 43% of the city’s workforce but account for just 21% of those employed in the tech sector, according to Center for an Urban Future (CUF) data.

Since 2007, employment in tech has grown 160% in the five boroughs. CUF, an independent think tank, is working with CUNY schools to ensure that all New Yorkers, regardless of their economic background, have access to this expanding field.  </p>

<p class="maintext"> Eli Dvorkin, the center’s editorial and policy director,  elaborated on their efforts to bring tech equity to New York. The think tank’s mission is to research policies that reduce inequality, increase economic mobility, and grow the economy.

“CUNY is arguably the most powerful engine of economic mobility that we have as a city to help New Yorkers achieve long-lasting career success and economic success at an affordable cost,” he said.

The CUF will continue its work with CUNY into 2024, and continue researching ways to leverage the Public University system to improve tech equity in NYC.
